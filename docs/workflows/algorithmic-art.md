# Algorithmic Art

> **Purpose**: Create generative art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive parameter exploration. Produces algorithmic philosophies, interactive HTML viewers, and JavaScript generative algorithms.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Generative Art** | Creating art using code, flow fields, or particle systems |
| **Algorithmic Art** | Building computational aesthetic pieces with seeded randomness |
| **Interactive Visuals** | Producing parameterized p5.js sketches with real-time controls |
| **Creative Coding** | Exploring emergent behavior and mathematical beauty through code |

## Process

### Step 1: Create an Algorithmic Philosophy

Define a computational aesthetic movement expressed through code:

1. **Name the movement** (1-2 words) - e.g., "Organic Turbulence", "Quantum Harmonics"
2. **Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) covering:
    - Computational processes and mathematical relationships
    - Noise functions and randomness patterns
    - Particle behaviors and field dynamics
    - Temporal evolution and system states
    - Parametric variation and emergent complexity
3. **Output** the philosophy as a `.md` file

### Step 2: Deduce the Conceptual Seed

Identify a subtle conceptual thread from the original request — a niche reference embedded within the algorithm itself, not literal but sophisticated. The reference should enhance depth without announcing itself.

### Step 3: Implement with p5.js

Build the generative art using the skill's HTML viewer template:

1. **Read** `assets/viewer.html` as the literal starting point
2. **Keep fixed sections** exactly as shown (header, sidebar, seed controls, actions)
3. **Replace variable sections** (algorithm, parameters, UI controls)
4. **Use seeded randomness** for reproducibility (Art Blocks pattern)
5. **Output** a single self-contained HTML file

### Step 4: Tune and Refine

Ensure gallery-quality output:

- **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise
- **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB
- **Composition**: Visual hierarchy even in randomness
- **Performance**: Smooth real-time execution
- **Reproducibility**: Same seed always produces identical output

## Key Principles

- **Process over product** — beauty emerges from the algorithm's execution
- **Parametric expression** — ideas communicate through mathematical relationships
- **Artistic freedom** — interpret the philosophy algorithmically
- **Expert craftsmanship** — the algorithm must feel meticulously crafted
- **Original work** — create original algorithmic art to avoid copyright violations
