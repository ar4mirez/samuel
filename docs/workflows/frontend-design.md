# Frontend Design

> **Purpose**: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Generates creative, polished code and UI design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## When to Use

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Web Components** | Building web components, pages, or applications |
| **Landing Pages** | Creating visually striking landing pages or dashboards |
| **UI Beautification** | Styling or beautifying any web interface |
| **Design-Driven Development** | When high design quality is a priority |

## Process

### Step 1: Design Thinking

Before coding, understand context and commit to a bold aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose** — what problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone** — pick a strong aesthetic: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
3. **Constraints** — technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
4. **Differentiation** — what makes this unforgettable?

### Step 2: Implementation

Build working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

### Step 3: Aesthetic Refinement

Focus on key design dimensions:

| Dimension | Guidance |
|-----------|----------|
| **Typography** | Distinctive font choices, not generic (avoid Arial, Inter, Roboto) |
| **Color & Theme** | Cohesive palette with CSS variables; dominant colors with sharp accents |
| **Motion** | CSS-only animations; staggered reveals on page load; scroll-triggered effects |
| **Spatial Composition** | Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements |
| **Backgrounds** | Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies |

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:

- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliche color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design without context-specific character
- Excessive centered layouts and uniform rounded corners

---

## Key Principles

- **Bold direction** — choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision
- **Match complexity to vision** — maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimalist needs restraint
- **Vary across generations** — never converge on common choices; each design should be unique
- **Context-specific** — interpret creatively for the specific use case
